## Hi there

Howdy, I'm a senior full-stack & blockchain developer.
I have over 12 years of experience in building websites & web apps & software development and 5 years of experience in blockchain projects.
I am very strong in building frontend UI based on responsive features, translating UX/UI designs into interactive interfaces, and collaborating with the backend for API & web3 integrations.
I have rich experience in building dapps, staking/farming/lending, NFT marketplace, P2E/bots etc, so I have been working in the blockchain field for around 5 years.
As a professional who has thrived in roles such as Project Manager and Lead Developer, I bring to the table a comprehensive blend of technical expertise and leadership acumen.

My comprehensive knowledge and experience span across:
